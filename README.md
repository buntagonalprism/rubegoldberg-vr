Liked: Most significant project of the nanodegree resulting in a game thats actually fun to play for extended periods
Challenging: Physics object behaviours - took a while to figure out how to have multiple primitive child colliders to represent more complex shapes, and that nesting and animating physics objects produced some very strange behaviour
Unity Version: 5.6.1 f1
Target VR Platform: HTC Vive
